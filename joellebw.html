				<p>Let me start by just expressing how much I appreciate that my
					girlfriend is always willing to be my beautiful model. I took this
					picture during the fall in Canton, CT. This photo actually was not
					posed, which I love. To me, candid photos are more genuine in every
					way. Poses aren't bad, but not everyone is comfortable posing. After
					years of editing photos that look forced, Ive learned to discover
					where people are most comfortable in front of the camera within the
					first few moments of a photo shoot. Some, like Joelle, are naturals
					through the lens, others just need to find some comfort in their own
					skin. One of the things I love about photography, is that I can draw
					peoples' attention to and from certain areas of a photo. For example,
					in this photo, I wanted everyone to focus on only Joelle.</p>
