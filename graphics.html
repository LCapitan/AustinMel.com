				<p>The day I stepped into my first Graphic Design class and was
				introduced to Photoshop was, and will always be, one of the greatest
				days of my life. I'll never forget Mr. Eisner showing us all of the
				things you could do with the program, I just remember thinking to
				myself, "Art is no longer just a hobby for me." As the class went on
				and we began to cover some more complex features, I was just taken back
				by the technology and the amount of things I could do with it. So of
				course, since I was young, I started drawing the only thing that my mind
			 	could thing to design...Spider-Man. Normally, some people would grow out
				that phase, I have not. I still love to draw him on my iPad and measure
				my progress.
				<br>
				<br>
				If you don't like Spider-Man, that's okay! I'll still happily design
				whatever you need, no matter how complex. From custom logos, to whole
				spreadsheets of icons or a brochure of brand standards, I can get you
				what you need, and exactly what you want.</p>
